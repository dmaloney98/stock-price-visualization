# Stock Price Visualization

This project provides a simple way to visualize the historical closing prices and moving averages of a stock using Python, yfinance, and Matplotlib. The example used in the project is for the Google stock (GOOGL), but it can be easily modified for any other stock by changing the stock ticker symbol.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- yfinance
- pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Install the required packages:
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib

2. Run the `main.py` script:

python main.py

This will fetch the stock data, calculate the moving average, and display the closing prices and moving average charts.
